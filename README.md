#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Backend delpoyed at [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/labs16-grantly) <br>

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Getting started

You will need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Package manager ([NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) was used to build this project and will continued to be used for maintenance)
  - NPM is distributed with Node.js- which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get NPM installed on your computer.

Once you have Node.js and NPM:

1. Fork and clone repo
2. Add an `.env` file at the root of folder. Add environment variables.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary node_modules.
4. Run `npm start` to start the application.

<!-- To get the server running locally:

üö´ adjust these scripts to match your project

- Clone this repo
- **yarn install** to install all required dependencies
- **yarn server** to start the local server
- **yarn test** to start server using testing environment -->

### Node.js

- Offers large number of free tools
- Exceptional speed and performance
- Works with JSON
- Maintains the same language throughout the project both on the client and server side

<!-- ### Backend framework goes here

üö´ Why did you choose this framework?

- Point One
- Point Two
- Point Three
